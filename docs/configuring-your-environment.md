## Configuring Your Environment

To get started, we highly recommend having the following tools installed:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (NOTE: please install the LTS version as we can't validate current will always work)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Verify your environment works

Open a command line and run these:

* Run `node -v` to check your node version! It should probably be 6.x.x.

* Run `npm -v` to check your npm version. If your version is below 5.x.x, run `npm install -g npm` to update it.

* Go to a folder and run `code .` to open VSCode in a folder. If you don't have VSCode in your path, you can open VSCode and press f1, type `path`, and select the `Install 'code' command in PATH` option.

* Run `git --version` to make sure you have git.
